# 2022-k08

Projects from my 2022 class "data structures and programming techniques" in C.

In project 1, along with 2 classmates, we created a game available here : https://k08.chatzi.org/games/2022/competition/StudioGhibliNerds/game.html

This game is based on the retro game River raid and the graphics are inspired from a scene in the movie "Spirited away".
The user controls the game with the arrows
(up : speed decrease, down: speed increase, left, right), can shoot helpers with the space bar and pause the
game by pressing P.
